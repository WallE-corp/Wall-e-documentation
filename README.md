# Architecture
The architecture of the entire system can be divided into three major components `Backend`, `Mobile` and `WallE`. These major components, in turn, have their own major sub-components. This chapter will provide an overview of each major component along with links to more detailed implementations.

### Major Components
## WallE
...

See [WallE](wallE/index.md) for implementation details.

## Backend
...

See [Backend](backend/index.md) for implementation details.

## Mobile
...

See [Mobile](mobile/index.md) for implementation details.
